# MERN stack boilerplate

The goal of this repo is to provide a starting point for a full stack web application using the MERN stack. I had inspiration for this boilerplate because I come across a lot of other boilerplates that use a ployrepo approach and also don't quite meet the requirements I've seeked. So in this project I'm learning and implementing ways to handle all dependencies in one package json file. Also avoid react-scripts dependencies from cra and handling configurations for build manually using webpack. Another concept behind this project is for team development. So implenting eslinting and pre-commit hooks to enforce best practices was another motivator.

This is by far completed as of yet, there are a lot more features I wish to implement for the base boilerplate.

## Tech stack

- React 18
- Express 4
- TypeScript 4
- Webpack 5

## Upcoming features

- enable live reloading for frontend in development environment
- add support for for file loading static image formats
- enable logging for eslint error during development
- improve configurations by combining shared values and follow dry methods
- implement react-router-dom for multiple pages in a application
- connect to MongoDB cluster via Docker image
- create reuseable crud api example and entity schema to base specific project requirements from
- implement unit testing for future CI/CD with AWS EC2 in mind
- setup github workflows for production build on push/pull request
- provide other security features such as CORS and helement

## Future goals

- production SSR/SSG build
- local strategy authentication and session management
- global state management with Redux

## Development

coming soon...
